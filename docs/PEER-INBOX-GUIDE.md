# Peer Inbox — User Guide

Cross-session messaging for Claude Code, Codex CLI, and Gemini CLI.
Two (or more) agent sessions on the same machine exchange labeled
messages; each answers from its own live context so fidelity stays
high and there's no manual copy-paste.

**Current version:** v1.5
**Architecture details:** [ARCHITECTURE.md](./PEER-INBOX-ARCHITECTURE.md)
**Version history:** [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md)

## TL;DR

```bash
# Terminal 1:
agent-collab session register --label backend --agent claude --role lead
agent-collab peer send --to frontend --message "auth token TTL is 15m now"

# Terminal 2:
agent-collab session register --label frontend --agent claude --role peer
# Messages from backend auto-inject into your context on every turn (Claude only).
# For Codex/Gemini, or to check without a prompt:
agent-collab peer receive --mark-read
```

For self-sustaining conversations (recipient wakes without a user prompt),

## Install

One-time, per machine:

```bash
cd ~/Development/agent-collaboration
./scripts/install-global-protocol
./scripts/doctor-global-protocol
```

Expected doctor output: `Summary: N PASS, 0 WARN, 0 BLOCK` (CLI-version
drift warnings are harmless).

The installer places:

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `~/.local/bin/agent-collab` | Main CLI (added to PATH via `~/.local/bin`) |
| `~/.agent-collab/scripts/peer-inbox-db.py` | Python helper — all SQLite work |
| `~/.agent-collab/scripts/peer-inbox-channel.py` | MCP channel server (v1.4+, opt-in) |
| `~/.agent-collab/hooks/peer-inbox-inject.sh` | `UserPromptSubmit` hook |
| `~/.claude/settings.json` | Gets a managed `UserPromptSubmit` hook entry (existing hooks preserved) |
| `~/.agent-collab/sessions.db` | SQLite store (created on first `session register`) |

Uninstall reverses all of it cleanly:

```bash
./scripts/install-global-protocol uninstall
# ~/.agent-collab/sessions.db is intentionally NOT deleted — user data.
```

---

## Core concepts

**Session.** One running `claude` / `codex` / `gemini` process. Each
registers with a short human label.

**Label.** How a session is addressed by peers. Pattern
`[a-z0-9][a-z0-9_-]{0,63}`. You pick it; it's scoped to your canonical
repo root (so `backend` in `dj/` is distinct from `backend` elsewhere).

**Canonical cwd.** The session's repo root, symlinks resolved. Walk-parents
discovery means you can invoke subcommands from any subdirectory.

**Session key.** Per-session discriminator used to tell same-cwd
sessions apart. Claude's hook provides it automatically (from the
session's stdin JSON); Codex/Gemini users set
`AGENT_COLLAB_SESSION_KEY` explicitly.

**Inbox.** Single SQLite file at `~/.agent-collab/sessions.db`.
Two tables matter to users:
- `sessions` — one row per registered session: `(cwd, label, agent, role, session_key, channel_socket, last_seen_at)`.
- `inbox` — every message, append-only: `(to_cwd, to_label, from_cwd, from_label, body, created_at, read_at)`.

**Delivery.** Messages always land in SQLite; how they reach the
*recipient's live context* depends on delivery mode. See
[Delivery modes](#delivery-modes).

---

## Subcommand reference

All commands are `agent-collab <group> <verb> [options]`. Groups:
`session`, `peer`. Run `agent-collab help` for the full summary.

### Sessions: register / close / list

#### `agent-collab session register`

```
--label <l>          required; [a-z0-9][a-z0-9_-]{0,63}
--agent <a>          required; claude | codex | gemini
--role <r>           optional; free-form (lead, peer, reviewer, …)
--cwd <path>         defaults to resolved canonical $PWD
--session-key <k>    optional; else env: AGENT_COLLAB_SESSION_KEY,
                     CLAUDE_SESSION_ID, CODEX_SESSION_ID, GEMINI_SESSION_ID;
                     else picked from the hook-logged seen-sessions
                     in this cwd
--force              override active-label collision
```

Creates a `sessions` row, writes a per-session marker at
`<cwd>/.agent-collab/sessions/<sha256-of-key>.json`, and (when a channel
is live in the ancestor process tree) binds the channel socket.

Output includes `[channel: paired]` or `[channel: none]`.

#### `agent-collab session close`

```
--label <l>          optional; inferred from marker via walk-parents
--session-key <k>    optional
```

Removes the session row and its marker. Inbox messages are preserved
for audit.

#### `agent-collab session list`

```
--all-cwds           show sessions in every cwd (default: this cwd only)
--include-stale      include sessions not seen in > 30 min
--json               machine-readable output
```

Activity states: `active` (<5 min), `idle` (5–30 min), `stale` (excluded
by default).

### Messaging: send / receive / list

#### `agent-collab peer send`

```
--to <label>                 required; recipient's label
--as <label>                 optional; override self-resolution
--to-cwd <path>              optional; for cross-cwd sends
--message <text> |
  --message-file <path> |    one-of required
  --message-stdin
```

Rules enforced:
- Body cap 8 KB.
- Recipient inactive >30 min → error `peer offline: <label>`.
- Pair `[[end]]`-terminated → rejected (see [reset](#agent-collab-peer-reset)).
- Pair turn count `>= AGENT_COLLAB_MAX_PAIR_TURNS` (default 20) → rejected.
- Body containing `[[end]]` (case-insensitive) marks pair terminated.

Output prefixed with push status: `(pushed)`, `(no-channel)`, or
`(push-failed(<code>))`.

#### `agent-collab peer receive`

```
--as <label>               optional; override self-resolution
--format hook|hook-json|plain|json     default: plain
--mark-read                atomic claim-and-mark (UPDATE … RETURNING)
--since <iso8601>          only messages newer than this timestamp
```

Without `--mark-read`: read-only, repeatable. Does not bump `last_seen_at`.
With `--mark-read`: atomic claim under `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` — no race
between concurrent receivers.

Format notes:
- `plain` — human-readable text.
- `json` — array of message objects.
- `hook` — just the `<peer-inbox>…</peer-inbox>` block (for embedding).
- `hook-json` — full Claude `UserPromptSubmit` hook envelope:
  `{"hookSpecificOutput": {"hookEventName": "UserPromptSubmit",
  "additionalContext": "<peer-inbox>…</peer-inbox>"}}`.

#### `agent-collab peer list`

```
--as <label>          optional
--include-stale       include peers not seen in > 30 min
--json                machine-readable output
```

Other sessions in the caller's cwd (self excluded).

### Observability: watch / web / replay

#### `agent-collab peer watch`

```
--as <label>          optional
--interval <sec>      default 1.0
--only-new            skip history; print only messages arriving after launch
--since-id <n>        start from inbox id
```

Blocks until Ctrl-C. Prints each incoming message with sender label,
timestamp, read-state marker (`*` = unread). Read-only; does not
mark-read. Good for a tmux side-pane.

#### `agent-collab peer web`

```
--as <label>          optional; narrow to label's conversations
--port <n>            default 8787
```

Blocks until Ctrl-C. Serves `http://127.0.0.1:<port>` — Slack-shaped
two-pane UI:

- **Left sidebar**: every pair (canonical `a < b`) grouped by activity
  (active / idle / stale / terminated). Unread badge on pairs that
  aren't currently selected. Click to switch.
- **Main pane**: selected pair's message stream. Pastel-pill sender
  labels, day separators, `[[end]]` renders with a warning border plus
  a "terminated" banner at the bottom.
- **Header**: peer details (agent type, role, channel pairing), turn
  count, activity dot.
- **Title flash** with total unread across non-focused pairs.
- `#pair=a+b` URL hash preselects a pair on load.

Endpoints (for scripting / dashboards):
- `GET /pairs.json` — every pair's metadata in this cwd.
- `GET /messages.json?a=backend&b=frontend&after=<id>` — messages for
  one pair, with optional delta cursor.
- `GET /messages.json?after=<id>` — all messages (back-compat with v1.5).

#### `agent-collab peer replay`

```
--as <label>          optional; narrow to label's conversations
--since <iso8601>     only messages newer than this
--out <path>          default: <cwd>/.agent-collab/replay-<ts>.html
```

Emits a **self-contained** HTML file — inline CSS, no external assets,
opens in any browser. Deterministic pastel color per sender, day
grouping, html-escaped bodies. Good for post-mortems or archiving a
specific handoff.

### Flow control: reset

#### `agent-collab peer reset`

```
--to <label>          required; the other side of the pair
--as <label>          optional
```

Clears both the turn counter and the `[[end]]` termination flag for the
pair `(self, other)` in the current cwd. Use after hitting the cap or
after a conversation was intentionally ended.

### Other helpers

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `agent-collab session adopt --label <l> --session-id <uuid>` | Re-key an existing registration to a specific Claude session_id. Use when the hook can't resolve self-identity because register happened before the hook logged the real session_id. |
| `agent-collab hook log-session --cwd <c> --session-id <id>` | Internal: called by the `UserPromptSubmit` hook on every turn to record the seen Claude session_id. Don't invoke manually. |

---

## Delivery modes

Every `peer send` always writes to SQLite (the source of truth). How
the message reaches the recipient's *live agent context* depends on
which delivery mode is active for the recipient.

### Hook (default)

On every `UserPromptSubmit` event, Claude's installed hook runs
`peer receive --format hook-json --mark-read` and prepends unread
messages to the agent's next turn as a `<peer-inbox>…</peer-inbox>`
block.

Characteristics:
- Requires no launch-flag change; works out of the box after install.
- Latency: **next user prompt in the recipient's session.**
- Doesn't self-sustain — each round-trip needs a human prompt in
  both sessions.
- Codex and Gemini have no `UserPromptSubmit` equivalent yet; use
  manual `peer receive` in those runtimes.

### Channels (real-time push, opt-in)

Uses Claude Code's [Channels](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/channels)
research-preview feature. Each session spawns a channel MCP subprocess
that listens on a Unix socket; `peer send` POSTs the message and
Claude sees it as `<channel source="peer-inbox" from="…">…</channel>`
in its running context **without a user prompt**.

#### Enable channels for a repo

1. Ensure `.mcp.json` in the repo root contains the peer-inbox entry:

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "peer-inbox": {
         "command": "python3",
         "args": ["/Users/<you>/.agent-collab/scripts/peer-inbox-channel.py"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. Launch each session with the channels flag:

   ```bash
   cd ~/Development/dj
   claude --dangerously-load-development-channels server:peer-inbox
   ```

3. Register normally. Look for `[channel: paired]` in the output.
   `register` walks its process tree to find Claude's pending-channel
   file and binds the socket path.

4. Send as usual. Status `(pushed)` means the recipient's channel
   received it.

#### Characteristics

- Real-time push; no turn-boundary wait.
- Self-sustaining — two agents can converse without human prompts.
- Requires Claude Code 2.1.78+ with the research-preview flag.
- `channelsEnabled: true` is required on Team/Enterprise plans.
- Sessions not on channels keep working — their sends fall back to
  the hook path.

#### Guardrails shipped by default

- **Max turns per pair.** Default 20 (`AGENT_COLLAB_MAX_PAIR_TURNS`).
  Further sends return an error with reset hint.
- **Explicit termination.** Any `peer send` whose body contains
  `[[end]]` (case-insensitive) marks the pair as terminated; subsequent
  sends in either direction are blocked until `peer reset`.
- `peer_pairs.terminated_by` records who ended the exchange.

### Auto-reply daemons

Topic 3 v0 adds an **auto-reply daemon** (`agent-collab-daemon`,
Go binary at `go/cmd/daemon/`) that gives Codex CLI and Gemini CLI
peer-inbox auto-reply parity with Claude Code. A daemon is an
OS-local process that watches the inbox for messages addressed to a
specific label and autonomously services them by spawning a fresh
`codex exec` / `gemini -p` / `claude -p` invocation per batch,
injecting the envelope as the spawn's user prompt, and waiting for a
completion-ack signal before moving to the next batch.

**When to use a daemon.** You have an interactive Codex or Gemini
session (or even a Claude session) and you want it to keep
autonomously replying to peer-inbox messages between your human
prompts — without you having to type anything in that session's
terminal. The daemon enables "send a message to Codex, walk away,
come back to see the reply" workflows that previously required a
Claude-Channels-paired session.

**When NOT to use a daemon.**
- Your Claude Code session already has the hook installed —
  messages auto-inject on every `UserPromptSubmit`. No daemon needed
  for turn-boundary delivery.
- Your Claude Code session is launched with Channels — messages
  push in real-time mid-turn. Daemon is turn-boundary-driven (fresh
  LLM per batch, W3 worker shape) and doesn't improve on this for
  Claude.
- Cross-host coordination. The daemon is single-machine-local;
  cross-host sync is deferred to v3.3+.

**Full operator guide:** [DAEMON-OPERATOR-GUIDE.md](./DAEMON-OPERATOR-GUIDE.md).
Covers config flags, architecture, the four-layer termination
stack, the completion-ack contract, troubleshooting, and the
security + cost model. **Topic 3 v0.1 adds Architecture D** (opt-in
CLI-native session-ID pass-through for cross-spawn context continuity
on codex + gemini; claude asymmetry documented) — see the operator
guide's Arch D section.

**Validation protocols:** [DAEMON-VALIDATION.md](./DAEMON-VALIDATION.md)
covers v0 E2E probes (E1-E4) for live-CLI delivery;
[DAEMON-CLI-SESSION-VALIDATION.md](./DAEMON-CLI-SESSION-VALIDATION.md)
covers v0.1 Arch D probes (E5-E7) for codex banner regex + gemini
`--list-sessions` parser drift detection. Both run at ship time to
complement the shape-2 CI gates at `tests/daemon-*.sh`.

## Per-runtime cheatsheet

| Need to… | Claude Code | Codex CLI | Gemini CLI |
|---|---|---|---|
| Register | bare `session register` (hook provides session key) | bare `session register` (hook provides session key) | bare `session register` (hook provides session key) |
| Auto-inject on turn start | Yes, via `UserPromptSubmit` hook | Yes, via `UserPromptSubmit` hook | Yes, via `BeforeAgent` hook |
| Real-time push (self-sustain) | `--dangerously-load-development-channels server:peer-inbox` | Not yet (see [Codex issue #18056](https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/18056) for upstream MCP notifications tracking) | Not supported (architectural; see Gemini issue #3052) |
| Auto-reply via daemon | Yes (`agent-collab-daemon --cli claude`; usually unnecessary given hook + Channels coverage) | Yes (`agent-collab-daemon --cli codex`) | Yes (`agent-collab-daemon --cli gemini`) |
| Cross-spawn context (Arch D opt-in, v0.1) | No — `claude -p` has no stable cross-process session-resume; daemon emits warn + falls back to Arch B | Yes — `codex exec resume <UUID>` | Yes — `gemini --resume <index>` (UUID stored, translated to current index at resume time) |
| Peer send | identical | identical | identical |

Installing the hook on all three CLIs is a single `scripts/install-global-protocol` run — it detects which CLI homes exist (`~/.claude`, `~/.codex`, `~/.gemini`) and registers the unified `hooks/peer-inbox-inject.sh` into each. Codex additionally gets `[features] codex_hooks = true` appended to `~/.codex/config.toml` (required by Codex for hooks to fire).

## Examples

### Two Claude sessions in the same repo

```bash
# Terminal 1, ~/Development/dj:
agent-collab session register --label backend --agent claude --role lead

# Terminal 2, ~/Development/dj:
agent-collab session register --label frontend --agent claude --role peer

# In backend, ask frontend about a contract:
agent-collab peer send --to frontend --message "
Changing auth middleware from 401 to 403 on expired tokens.
Does the iOS app distinguish? Reply with [[end]] when done."

# Frontend's next prompt auto-injects this. Frontend replies via peer_send;
# backend's next prompt auto-injects the reply.
```

### Self-sustaining exchange via channels

```bash
# Both terminals, launch:
claude --dangerously-load-development-channels server:peer-inbox

# Each registers (channel pairs automatically).

# Kick it off from backend:
agent-collab peer send --to frontend --message "
Draft the migration 036 rollback plan in 3 bullets. Reply and include [[end]]."

# Walk away. Frontend wakes without prompting, replies. Backend wakes,
# reads reply, might respond further, or the [[end]] token stops the loop.
```

Watch it live:

```bash
agent-collab peer web --port 8787 &
open http://127.0.0.1:8787
```

### Claude-led challenge review via peer send

```bash
# Claude (lead) drafts migration, asks Codex (challenger) to review:
agent-collab peer send --to reviewer --message "
Migration 036: NOT NULL column on user_agents (50M rows).
Proposed: batched UPDATE in 10k chunks. Challenge rollback + concurrency."

# Codex runs peer receive, reviews from its own live repo context, sends
# back via peer send. Two-round protocol cap + evidence-first rules from
# the collaboration protocol still apply — peer messages are just
# challenge passes carried on a different transport.
```

### Archive a finished exchange

```bash
agent-collab peer replay --as backend --out ~/Desktop/backend-review.html
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### `no session key available`

Register refused because no session-key source was found. Claude Code's
hook logs session_ids to `~/.agent-collab/claude-sessions-seen/` on
every turn. Fixes, in order of preference:

1. Type any prompt first (even "hi") so the hook logs the session_id,
   then retry register.
2. Set `AGENT_COLLAB_SESSION_KEY` explicitly:

   ```bash
   export AGENT_COLLAB_SESSION_KEY="$(uuidgen)"
   ```

3. Pass `--session-key <k>` to register.

### `multiple sessions registered in <path>; pass --as <label>`

You're in a repo with more than one registered session and neither a
session key nor `--as` is set. Either export a session key matching one
of them, or pass `--as <label>` explicitly:

```bash
agent-collab peer receive --as backend --mark-read
```

### Existing registration's session_key doesn't match Claude's session_id

Symptom: the hook fires (visible in `~/.agent-collab/hook.log`) but
fails with "multiple sessions registered". Cause: the session registered
with a random key before the hook logged the real session_id.

Find the real session_id and adopt:

```bash
# Peek at what the hook has logged for this cwd:
ls ~/.agent-collab/claude-sessions-seen/
cat ~/.agent-collab/claude-sessions-seen/<hash>.log

# Adopt (from inside the mis-registered session):
agent-collab session adopt --label <your-label> --session-id <claude-uuid>
```

### `peer offline: <label>`

The recipient hasn't been seen in > 30 min. Check:

```bash
agent-collab peer list --include-stale
```

### `path drift: marker at X records cwd Y`

A marker file was copied (e.g., `rsync`ed across machines). Re-register:

```bash
agent-collab session register --label <your-label> --agent <...> --force
```

### Hook isn't injecting messages into Claude

In order:

1. `./scripts/doctor-global-protocol` — any BLOCKs?
2. `tail ~/.agent-collab/hook.log` — last failure line.
3. `agent-collab peer receive` — does it show unread?
4. `python3 -m json.tool ~/.claude/settings.json | grep peer-inbox` —
   hook entry present?
5. **Restart the Claude session** — settings.json changes apply on
   session start, not mid-session.

### Channel paired but messages don't arrive

1. Is the channel process alive?
   `ps -ef | grep peer-inbox-channel.py`
2. Is the socket present?
   `ls -la /tmp/peer-inbox/`
3. Is the `.mcp.json` entry correct and the session launched with
   `--dangerously-load-development-channels server:peer-inbox`?
4. Inspect `~/.agent-collab/hook.log` and the channel's own stderr
   (routed via `claude --debug hooks`).

### Hit the max-turns cap or accidentally terminated

```bash
agent-collab peer reset --to <other-label>
```

### Uninstall and start fresh

```bash
./scripts/install-global-protocol uninstall
rm -rf ~/.agent-collab       # WARNING: nukes sessions.db (history gone)
./scripts/install-global-protocol
```

## Configuration reference

Environment variables read by `peer-inbox-db.py` and the channel server:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `AGENT_COLLAB_INBOX_DB` | `~/.agent-collab/sessions.db` | SQLite database path |
| `AGENT_COLLAB_SESSION_KEY` | — | Explicit session key (highest precedence) |
| `CLAUDE_SESSION_ID` | (set by hook) | Claude's runtime session ID; propagated by the hook |
| `CODEX_SESSION_ID` | — | Session discriminator for Codex runs |
| `GEMINI_SESSION_ID` | — | Session discriminator for Gemini runs |
| `AGENT_COLLAB_MAX_PAIR_TURNS` | `20` | Max turns per pair before send rejection |
| `AGENT_COLLAB_HOOK_LOG` | `~/.agent-collab/hook.log` | Hook failure log location |
| `PEER_INBOX_SOCKET_DIR` | `/tmp/peer-inbox` | Channel Unix socket directory (short, for macOS AF_UNIX 104-char cap) |
| `PEER_INBOX_PENDING_DIR` | `~/.agent-collab/pending-channels` | Channel-server process registry (for register pairing) |

Config file overrides (`.agent-collab.env` at a repo root):

```
AGENT_COLLAB_INBOX_DB=/path/to/custom.db
```

Only explicit env overrides caller-provided config. See
[LOCAL-INTEGRATION.md](./LOCAL-INTEGRATION.md) for the full config-file
schema.

## Limits and non-goals

- **Same machine only.** SQLite is local. Cross-host sync is
  out-of-scope for v1.x.
- **Mid-turn async push is Claude-only today.** All three CLIs
  auto-inject on turn start via the unified hook (Claude
  `UserPromptSubmit`, Codex `UserPromptSubmit`, Gemini `BeforeAgent`).
  Mid-turn notifications that arrive while an agent is working
  surface in Claude via the peer-inbox MCP channel but not in Codex
  (blocked on [Codex issue #18056](https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/18056))
  or Gemini (structurally declined per their issue #3052). The
  Topic 3 v0 auto-reply daemon closes the Codex / Gemini parity gap
  for *reactive* behavior (fresh LLM per batch at turn boundaries,
  W3 worker shape per
  [DAEMON-OPERATOR-GUIDE.md](./DAEMON-OPERATOR-GUIDE.md)) but is
  still turn-boundary-driven — it does not enable mid-turn push
  into an already-running Codex / Gemini session.
- **Message bodies are UTF-8 text**, 8 KB max. Binary / `\0` bytes
  are not supported — base64-encode externally if needed.
- **No archive or retention.** V1 retains every message forever.
  Direct SQL on `~/.agent-collab/sessions.db` is the audit surface.
  V2 may add a retention spec if a real need emerges.
- **Channels are research-preview.** The `--dangerously-load-development-channels`
  flag and notification schema could change in any Claude Code
  release. Pin your Claude Code version in operational docs.
- **Prompt injection is a real surface.** Anyone with write access to
  the inbox (or who can POST to a channel's socket) can inject content
  Claude will see as context. For DJ-personal use this is fine; for
  multi-user or shared environments, gate sender identity carefully.
